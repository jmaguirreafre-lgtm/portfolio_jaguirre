### Business Performnace 

Process: 
Define the Problem and Objectives - Planned the desired outcome by asking sufficient questions and narrowed the description to specific objectives to work on
Data Collection - Reviewed the database and, based on the objectives, confirmed whether the data collected was sufficient for the desired outcome
Data Cleaning and Processing - After reviewing, I used DBeaver to run queries in SQL to clean and extract the critical information needed
Exploratory Analysis - Created initial visualizations to identify overall patterns, detect anomalies in the data (to request their correction), and developed initial hypotheses
Statistical Analysis - I reviewed the current patterns to confirm data integrity and to interpret the existing data
Visualization and Communication - Once I had all the desired information and confirmed its integrity, I created the appropriate visualizations to share the results and insights with stakeholders

Tools and resources: 
  Database - PostgreSQL database
  DBeaver - SQL coding to clean the database and extract critical information
  Looker Studio - For data visualization

Data: 
  Postgres Database - Internal data collection and management system within the company
    - To ensure data integrity, I ran 3 different querys for different dashboards within one report
