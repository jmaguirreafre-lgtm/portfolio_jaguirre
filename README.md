### Business Performnace 

Process: 
Define the Problem and Objectives - Planned the desired outcome by asking sufficient questions and narrowed the description to specific objectives to work on.<br/>
Data Collection - Reviewed the database and, based on the objectives, confirmed whether the data collected was sufficient for the desired outcome.<br/>
Data Cleaning and Processing - After reviewing, I used DBeaver to run queries in SQL to clean and extract the critical information needed.<br/>
Exploratory Analysis - Created initial visualizations to identify overall patterns, detect anomalies in the data (to request their correction), and developed initial hypotheses.<br/>
Statistical Analysis - I reviewed the current patterns to confirm data integrity and to interpret the existing data.<br/>
Visualization and Communication - Once I had all the desired information and confirmed its integrity, I created the appropriate visualizations to share the results and insights with stakeholders

Tools and resources: 
  Database - PostgreSQL database.<br/>
  DBeaver - SQL coding to clean the database and extract critical information.<br/>
  Looker Studio - For data visualization.<br/>

Data: 
  Postgres Database - Internal data collection and management system within the company.<br/>
    - To ensure data integrity, I ran 3 different querys for different dashboards within one report

Business Problem: 
  Optimize resources, gain clarity about their own transactions, gain efficiency in their operations and resources

Objectives: 
  Identify which revenue sources are most profitable and consistent to optimize business development and resource allocation.<br/>
  Categorize, track, and optimize business expenses to improve operational efficiency and reduce unnecessary costs.<br/>
  Understand personnel costs and allocation efficiency to optimize team productivity and project profitability.<br/>

Purpose: 
  Provide actionable insights on financial performance, risk exposure, and resource optimization to support strategic decision-making.

  Where is the revenue concentrated, and what are the associated risks?.<br/>
  Which expense categories offer the greatest optimization opportunities?.<br/>
  How efficiently are we allocating team resources to maximize profitability?.<br/>
  Are we accurately estimating project costs, and which projects deviate most from budget?.<br/>
  How dependent are we on our top customers, and what is our revenue diversification risk?.<br/>
  Which revenue streams are most profitable, and where should we invest resources?.<br/>
  What are our revenue patterns, and how can we improve cash flow predictability?.<br/>
